<p>The year 2020 has certainly been an unexpected period of time for everyone. The pandemic put a halt on many businesses including the live music industry, but despite the lack of places to perform and tour cancelations, artists have continued to pump out hit after hit.</p>

<p>For some well-known artists, the time spent in quarantine led to the best year of their career and for others it’s been an incredible beginning. Since the late ‘50s, The Billboard Hot 100 has kept track of the most popular songs on a weekly basis in an order starting with the most played track based on airtime from the radio, sales and online streams.</p> 

<p>With so many new singles, collaborations and albums having been released over the past several months, here is a look at the top trending artists from each week of 2020 up to the current week, as seen on The Billboard Hot 100. So far, the most frequent Billboard chart-topping artists of the year have been Roddy Ricch with his song “The Box”, The Weeknd with “Blinding Lights”, Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion with “WAP”, DaBaby featuring Roddy Ricch with “Rockstar”, BTS with “Dynamite” as well as “Life goes on” and most recently, 24kGoldn featuring iann dior with “Mood”.</p></div>

<p>Starting in early January and continuing until the week of July 5, Roddy Ricch remained within the first 10 spots of the Hot 100 chart with his song “The Box”.  Of those weeks, 11 were consecutively spent in the number one slot making his single one of the most played songs of the year.</p>

<p>Roddy Ricch could also technically be considered one of the most played artists of the year as he was also featured in DaBaby’s song “Rockstar” which spent seven weeks in total in the number one spot. After the first two weeks, the song briefly was knocked out of first place following the release of “Trolls” by 6ix9ine featuring Nicki Minaj.</p>

<p>With almost as many weeks in the first spot of the Hot 100 list, the song “Mood” by 24kGoldn featuring iann dior has spent six weeks at number one and may potentially gain a seventh week by this coming Sunday. The single has remained within the top 10 songs of the chart since October but faced competition from “Positions” by Ariana Grande and “Life Goes On” by BTS. With the recent release of a second album this year from Taylor Swift, “Mood” may lose it’s spot once again.</p>

<p>Many have called this the best year for The Weeknd as the hit single “Blinding Lights” touched number one the week of April 4 and remained number first for 2 weeks before Drake’s “Tootsie Slide” bumped it down to second. The following week, the single went back to being number one and remained for an additional week totaling to four weeks in the top spot.</p>

<p>“WAP” by Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion stayed at number one for four weeks but not consecutively as the song was competing with “Dynamite” by BTS. The Korean pop boyband held the number one spot for 3 weeks in total and had an additional week after the popularity of their song “Life Goes On”.</p>

<p>For several of this year’s hottest singles, the popularity can likely be attributed to the fast-growing TikTok community. The app TikTok which was originally known as Musical.ly is an app where users can upload short videos and sounds of their own content or make a video using an already existing sound on the platform.</p>

<p>Before the name change, the app was known mostly for dance trends and lip singing along to popular songs. Since then, its audience has grown even more and many have called it “the new Vine” in reference to the popular app from several years ago.</p>

<p>The dancing, however, has not faded especially as majority of the world remains in quarantine to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Users of all ages have found comfort in connecting with others through the app by participating in different dance trends and creating new ones in hopes that they will catch on in the community.</p>

<p>Many of the songs on the Billboard Hot 100 list have been part of the dance trends on TikTok including “The Box” and “Blinding Lights”. The female rap artist Doja Cat who has had success on the charts with her song “Say So” even claims that much of it came from the dance videos that were made on the app and she featured the dance’s original creator in her music video when it released in February.</p>

<p>With all of the love for the songs that have topped the Billboard charts, many expected to see them be nominated for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards which are coming up on January 31 of next year. Some of the nominations are familiar, but others have left many feeling disappointed.</p>
<p>Among the nominations are “Rockstar” by DaBaby featuring Roddy Ricch, “Say So” by Doja Cat, “Circles” by Post Malone and “Savage” by Megan Thee Stallion for Record of the Year. “The Box” by Roddy Ricch was also nominated for Song of the Year and Best Rap Song.</p>

<p>Both “The Box” and “Rockstar” were nominated for Best Melodic Rap Performance while BTS received a nomination for Best Group Performance. The category Best New Artist includes nominations for both Doja Cat and Megan Thee Stallion.</p>

<p>The most surprising thing to many fans was the complete lack of nominations for The Weeknd. Despite the extreme popularity of the song “Blinding Lights” and the release of the single as well as the album “After Hours” being within the eligibility period, the singer was not given a single nomination.</p>

<p>Some took to Twitter to air their frustrations with The Academy. (pictures to come)</p>

<p>Another popular platform for keeping track of today’s hottest hits is Spotify the online listening service. Every year, Spotify puts together what they call “Spotify Wrapped” which is a summary of data from that year’s most popular music and each individual listener also receives statistics on what their most popular songs, artists and genres were for that year.</p>

<p>Recently, Spotify released their “2020 Wrapped” and announced their most streamed artists globally as Bad Bunny in first place, Drake in second, J Balvin in third, the late rapper Juice WRLD in fourth and The Weeknd in fifth. The most streamed song globally is “Blinding Lights” by The Weeknd with 1.6 billion streams this year according to the Spotify blog.</p>

<p>The song “The Box” by Roddy Ricch came shortly behind as the third most streamed song this year which is a fairly big difference from what is seen on the Billboard Hot 100. The album “After Hours” by The Weeknd is also featured as one of the most streamed albums of the year according to the Spotify data.</p>

<p>With the recent release of individual Spotify Wrapped statistics, we sent around a poll to the University of Maryland students to see how their individual top artists and genres compared to what was the most popular overall. What we found was majority of the students who responded out of a sample of over 100 gave a different artist as their most listened to artist for the year. Over 70 students had a different artist listed while only a small percentage gave the same names.</p>

</script></div></div></div>

<div></div>

<p>Some of those names included Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Ariana Grande, Kanye West and Post Malone. The top genre reported by over half of the students in the survey is pop and following in second and third is rock and rap. 
This is a fairly small sample size and it’s only taken from one particular university, but the results were fairly surprising in comparison to what has been popular in the music charts and on Spotify.</p>

<p>We also asked the students in the survey to give us recommendations for songs to add in a playlist and many of them chose to give several.</p>
