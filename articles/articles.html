            <div class="col-12">Comedian Benji Lovitt performed for over 80 students over Zoom on Nov. 5 as part of a Terps for Israel event, uniting comedy lovers from Hillel Montreal, Tulane University for Israel, GW for Israel and Huskies. “Laugh with Lovitt” was created as part of a fundraiser to support the Koby Mandell Foundation, which works to help those who have lost loved ones to terror and other tragedies, to rebuild their lives and create meaning out of suffering, according to their website. Participants were encouraged to make donations to the foundation throughout the event with a prize offered to the university that raises the most money raised (to be announced).</div>

            <div class="col-12">Students and campus groups at this university found inventive ways to continue celebratory traditions despite the limits on in-person campus events. Sukkot celebrates the gathering of the harvest and commemorates the protection God provided for Jews in the desert when they left Egypt. Part of the celebration for this holiday includes gathering under a Sukkah, or outdoor shelter, to share a meal, spend time together and sometimes, even sleep there.</div>

            <div class="col-12">Students gathered at the mall in front of Mckeldin Library last Friday to watch the first in-person comedy show on campus since the beginning of the pandemic. While sitting in bubbles painted six feet apart on the lawn, students followed social distancing guidelines and watched UMD’s only all improv comedy group Erasable Inc. perform their first Friday show of the semester on Sept. 25. Many joined bringing blankets and lawn chairs as the group played some familiar games that haven’t been seen since pre-pandemic days such as “Sex with Me” and “Pan Left Pan Right”. </div>

On the night of Saturday April 11, several UMD comics from different groups and students performed live on Instagram for an audience of comedy lovers. The live stream was hosted by Maddie Herron, a member of Sketchup, UMD’s premier sketch comedy group since 1996, who led the stream by inviting several comics to join one by one in a talk show style chat.</div>
